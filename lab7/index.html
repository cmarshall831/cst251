  <h1>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had some problems with styling my image and content. Brianna and I were able
       to figure it out.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I had some problems understanding CSS and classes and IDs. I think I will keep learning
       and get better at this as time goes on.</p>
