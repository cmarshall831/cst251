<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
	<p> The objective of this lab was to introduce proper file structure in order
			to keep our files organized and in the right place. We also learned how to
			add photos and bulleted lists to our websites.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> I found this lab to be mostly easy because the HTML was already set up in
			each of the file folders. It was a little bit confusing adding the photo
			and making sure it is from the right folder, but my partner helped me out.
			I was able to complete the second part pretty easily on my own using Wes'
			instruction.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> The results of this lab can be viewed here or in my index.html website page. </p>
