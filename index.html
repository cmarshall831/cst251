	<h1>Hello class! This is Connor Marshall's webpage.</h1>
	<p>I am from Pacific Grove, and this is my third year of college. I did not
		know what I wanted to do for a major until I found Communication Design. So
		far, I am loving it. I am very excited to take your class this year and get
		to know how to code and design web pages!
