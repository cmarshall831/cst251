    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>This lab was a bit challenging for me because I am still learning the basics
        CSS and how to style with it. I eventually found an easy way for me to remember
        how to organize and style my classes and id's.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I had a problem with trying to figure out how to make the image change size
        when it is hovered over. I also had some problems with nesting and styling specific
        but I figured out how to do it and keep it neat.</p>
