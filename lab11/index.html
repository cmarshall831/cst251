    <h1>Lab 11: Advanced Block-leveling Styling 1</h1>
  </div>

  <aside id="sidebar">
  <p>This is my sidebar, where I will give you a few paragraphs about myself. I was born in Mountain View on May 26, 2000. I have lived in Pacific Grove for most of my life, and after
  moving back from Sonoma, I am starting to really appreciate it more. I am currently a Junior at CSUMB after two years spent at Sonoma State University.
  I have played sports all my life, and my father even played D1 basketball at San Jose State, so he was able to teach me all about the game. I have a brother and sister, both of which
  are younger.</p>
  <p>Some of my hobbies include basketball, baseball, skateboarding, video games, editing videos, hanging with my friends, walking and spending time with my dog, and spending time
    with my family. My family is very close and we do a lot of things together. This Saturday we are leaving on a road trip to Colorado, where I will get to see my baby cousin for the
    first time. I am really excited to go because I have never been to Colorado, but I have heard it is very pretty and nice there.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>I found this lab to be a bit challenging. First, my partner and I were confused on how the sidebar was supposed to look after we styled it in CSS. I ended up using the
      W3 School's example to style the sidebar, and I am actually happy with how it came out after I edited it a little bit. I did not want to simply copy and paste my last lab
      this time because I felt like this lab was focused more on creating and styling the sidebar, rahter than the site as a whole. I focused more on trying different edits to make
      my sidebar look as clean as possible.</p>

    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>I had some problems with putting the sidebar into the right place and making sure it did not move when you scroll down the page. I found this difficult because
      there are many different styling elements that you have to use in order to make the sidebar the way you want. Of course, every sidebar will look different, but I tried
      my hardest to follow Wes' directions while making my sidebar look customized. I really enjoyed learning about this aspect of website design because sidebars are great
      ways to organize the page and allow the user to quickly access important links, ads, or info. Honestly, one of my main problems is choosing a color sceme that looks nice
      as well as a page setup that dose not look plain and jumbled. I have learned a lot from my partner, as she has a better eye for design than I.</p>

    <h4>Results</h4>
    <p>I am going to add my results here as well as some other images/text in order to make the page long enough to scroll. If they seem random, please direguard.</p>
